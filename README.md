# Emotionally Intelligent Agent-Based Systems

This project is a Python-based framework for designing emotionally intelligent agent-based systems through co-design.
It is inspired by Prof. Leon Sterling's work in motivational modeling and intelligent systems for meaningful, human-centered computing.

## Features
- Agent behavior modeling with emotional logic
- Python-first implementation
- Co-design friendly structure for research and experimentation
- Modular and open-source

## Structure
- `/src` – core Python modules
- `/notebooks` – Jupyter notebooks for testing and demo
- `/docs` – research summary and design principles

## License
